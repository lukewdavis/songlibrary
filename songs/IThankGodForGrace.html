			<pre>
[Verse 1]
I have seen the ruined lives of millions bound by sin
I have seen those in the ghetto, with a bottle in their hand
Yet I know, this could be me, I could in that same place
But I'm washed and redeemed, I thank God for grace
        
[Chorus]
Unworthy of mercy, yet I'm free and saved
Unworthy of royal blood, that flows through my veins
If not for Calvary, where would I be today
I was blind now I see
I thank God for grace
        
[Verse 2]
Nothing good I have done, to deserve this grace
I found I was lost as could be, when His hand reached way down
Where once I had nothing, I now have everything
Oh, I thank God for grace, that saved a wretch like me
        
[Ending]
Grace, grace, God's grace
Grace that is greater than all my sin
If not for Calvary, where would I be today
I was blind now I see
I thank God for grace
