			<pre>
[Chorus]
Oh what a beautiful City, oh what a beautiful City
God knows it's a beautiful city
Twelve gates to the City, hallelu, amen

[Verse 1]
Well, I didn't see no temple in the city
I saw God and a Lamb instead
I saw the glory of God give the light of the lamb
Was a lamb like the revalator said

Every tribe, nation and tongue
Walking together as one
And all the kings of the Earth were bringing their worth
To the city that needs no sun

[Verse 2]
The Alpha and the Omega
The beginning and the end
The lion and the lamb, the great I am
He's got a message for every kind of man

If your thirsty come to the city
Come drink from the water of life
There is no cost, don't stay lost
Come inherit your eternal life

[Verse 3]
Well there are three gates in the East,
three gates in the West Three gates in the North,
three gates in the South
And that makes Twelve gates to the City, hallelu, amen
