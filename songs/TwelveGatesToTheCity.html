			<pre>
[Chorus]
There are twelve gates to the City, hallelu, hallelu
There are twelve gates to the City, hallelu, hallelu
Oh what a beautiful City, oh what a beautiful City
I can see my Savior standing there

[Verse 1]
You know John said he saw the City of Great God
And the center was four square wide
He steadied himself and then he looked again
He saw Jesus on the other side
You know my God spoke to the revelator John
Said John don't you write no more
He said time has been, won't be no more
I'm going to close up the Heaven's door

[Verse 2]
You know John was preaching, preaching to the nation
That had absolutely no civilization
You read in your Bible about it in the garden
God made Heaven and Earth creation
He raised His head, He flashed His eyes
The light from Heaven shown down
Then He stood on the banks of Jordan
He looked and my God's work was done

[Verse 3]
Now when I get up in the City gonna see my mother; shake her hand
Gonna see my father; tour the city;
gonna ask my Lord for new shoes
Gonna walk all around Jerusalem

[Verse 4]
Well there are three gates in the East,
three gates in the West Three gates in the North,
three gates in the South
Three gates open over there I got my salvation and I won't be late
Three gates open over there St. Peter open up those golden gates, you know
