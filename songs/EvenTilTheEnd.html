[Verse 1]
C	   Em	     F
Jesus is my high tower
 	Dm	    G	     C
My light in the dark hour
 	Am	       Dm	      G
Without Him, I could not see
C	   Em	         F
He is closer than a brother
  Dm	   G	      C
Above Him there's no other
 	Am	     Dm	           G
Without Him, Where would I be
 	F	  G7	           C	Bb/C
Oh Jesus, What a friend is He		


[Chorus]
C/E  F                           F/G
For, He is the Rock upon which I stand
    C              G/B              Am
And He's a present help in time of need
    Dm              G7
And when this whole world
            C     G/B    Am
Has left me all alone
      Dsus           D                Gsus   G
Then, I can feel Him walking right by me
C/E      F
And when Everyone walks out,
                     F/G
That's when He walks in
C             G/B               Am
Proving once again that He's my dearest Friend
       Dm                        Gsus
And He Promised He'd go with me always
G            C
Even til the end


[Verse 2]
    C       Em                  F
And just as long as this world stands
   Dm       G         C
He promised he would hold my hand
Am                Dm        G
And that I would never walk alone
    C             Em         F
And He said, He'd go with me always
Dm           G         C
Through good times and through hard days
Am             Dm         G
He would be my Friend, my Guide
    F               G                 C    Bb/C
Oh, Jesus, He's the Best Friend in my Life
