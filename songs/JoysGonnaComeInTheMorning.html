[Verse 1]
I struggled with old satan's myth my life would never change.
With a broken heart as things grew dark I called on Jesus name.
I must confess my soul is at rest satan better heed this warning.
God said it's done the victory is won and joy's gonna come in the morning.

[Chorus]
Hallelujah I hear the voice of the Lord joy's gonna come in the morning.
The sun's gonna shine it's just about time joy's gonna come in the morning.
The devil has lost this battle, he can't hold back the dawning.
Weeping may endure for the night but joy's gonna come in the morning.

[Verse 2]
You've fought the fight to stand the night the darkness seemed so long.
You held onto the power you knew and it has made you strong.
No stopping now by faith somehow you see the light a dawning.
That eastern sky bye and bye joy's gonna come in the morning.
