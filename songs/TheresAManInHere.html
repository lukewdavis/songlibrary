			<pre>
[Verse 1]
There's a Man in here that I'm looking for
Cried the man who could find no room at the door
So they lowered him down on a stretcher bed
And Jesus looked at him and said
All your sins are gone now
Go this day take up your bed and be on your way
As he pressed through the crowd I heard him declare
I can tell you all there's a Man in there
        
[Chorus]
There's a Man in here who turns water to wine
And He walks on the water and gives sight to the blind
And He gives back life to the ones that's dead
And He fed five thousand with two fishes and bread
There's a Man in here who makes demons flee
Who makes cripples walk and He's chosen even me
He lives in my heart and I have no fear
I'm a better man 'cause there's a Man in here

[Verse 2]
There's a Man in here the disciples cried
As the ship was tossed from side to side
So they woke Him up, as the waves grew high
And said don't you care that we're about to die
And He said peace be still and the winds obeyed
He said where's your faith, why were you so afraid
When they saw that sea was smooth and clear
They said thank You God there's Man is here
