			<pre>
[Verse 1]
There are many new roads we see each day
Each one claims they are the way
To a life of satisfaction
more than we've dreamed
They are lined with things
that please the eye
But they cannot satisfy
So I decided to walk the
highway with the redeemed

[Chorus]
I'll take the old higway
The one that's called straight
It's so very narrow 
All the way to the gate
It started at Calvary
that's where I got on
It's the old old highway paved
with grace all the way home

[Verse 2]
Our highway may look to worldly men
Like it's a road to a bitter end
For we are promised
tribulations all along
The difference is easy to explain
for we have everything to gain
So just count me in
the number going home
