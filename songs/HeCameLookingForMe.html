			<pre>
[Verse 1]
One night while on life's raging sea it looked as if I would suffer defeat.
As the blackness of night closed off the light my heart sank with fear.
My desperate cry rang out with fright; all I could see was no hope in sight.
With faith all but gone I met the one who came looking for me.

[Chorus]
He came looking for me, He came looking for me.
He made a way when there was no way that I could see.
When I drifted so far Jesus was near to rescue my soul and calms all my fears.
Now I'm safe from all harm since I met the one who came looking for me.

[Verse 2]
Satan had already picked out my grave, his plan had moved forward to put me away.
I'd drifted so far, would anyone care that I'd soon be lost.
I knew my destruction was a matter of time but Jesus appeared and said this one is mine.
Now I'm safe with no harm for he walked through the storm
When he was looking for me.
