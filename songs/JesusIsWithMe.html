[Chorus]
Well, Jesus is with me when the storm clouds gather
He’s standing by my side when I hear the thunder roll
He holds my hand when I begin to tremble
When the winds of this world are blowing strong

[Verse 1]
Well, Jesus is a fence around His children
His grace, it is sufficient to stand the storm
and His word is a promise we can lean on
When the winds of this old world are blowing strong
 
[Verse 2]
Well, satan is always sneaking around the gate
he’s trying to lead sheep astray
O’ But the Holy Ghost that’s within us 
is so much greater than he 
when we rebuke him and chase him away
 
[Verse 3]
You see satan is roaming to and fro throughout the land
he’s seeking whom he might devour
O’ But he was defeated at golgotha
That day when Jesus made him out a liar

[Verse 4] 
Well, if you are caught out in the winds of this world 
with no joy… in your life at all
O’ just give your heart to Jesus
He will always understand
He will never! Never let you fall
