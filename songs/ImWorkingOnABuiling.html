[Chorus]
D
I'm workin' on a building'
D
I'm workin' on a building'
D                                   A           D
I'm workin' on a building' for my lord, for my lord

D
It's a holy ghost building, 
D
It's a holy ghost building 
D                                  A             D
It's a holy ghost building for my Lord, for my Lord

[Verse 1]
D
If I was a liar I tell you what I would do
D                     A                   D
Iâ€™d quit my lying and work on a building too

[Verse 2]
D
If I was a gambler, I tell you what I would do,
D                            A                     D
I'd quit my gamblin' and I'd work on the buildin' too

[Verse 3]
D
If I was a drunkard, I tell you what I would do,
D                             A                    D
I'd quit my drinkin' and I'd work on the buildin' too

[Verse 4]
     D
If I was a preacher, I tell you what I would do,
                               A                    D
I'd keep on preachin' and I'd work on the buildin' too

[Verse 5]
D
If I was a sinner, I tell you what I would do,
D                            A                    D
I'd quit my sinnin' and I'd work on the buildin' too
