[Chorus]
I played in the band, I sang in a choir
I wrote a few songs that gave a few people hope
Every once in a while I started a fire
When they asked me up there what did you do down there
I’ll say it was my heart felt desire
To play in the band, to write a few songs, and sing in the choir

[Verse]
Some think you got to be the big dog and lead all the little dogs around
You’ve got to sing a solo, preach a great sermon or be the biggest hottest thing in town
I guess I’m just a simple man with a simple desire
To play in the band, write a few songs, Lord I want to sing in the choir
