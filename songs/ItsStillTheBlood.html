[Verse 1]
               C
ONCE I WANDERED IN SINS BLACK NIGHT
      G            C                G
THERE WAS NO WAY TO MAKE MY WRONGS RIGHT
C                                    F
THEN THE OLD ACCUSER TO THE LORD DID CRY
C                   G          C
HE IS A SINNER AND NOW HE MUST DIE

D
THEN I HEARD A VOICE SAY, “FATHER, ILL GO”
A                            D         A
AND I'LL PAY HIS SIN DEBT IN CALVARY'S FLOW
D                                     G
I'LL BEAR IN MY BODY THE MARKS OF THE CROSS
D                         A            D
TO SAVE THIS CHILD WHO IS SIN SICK AND LOST


[Chorus]
D
AND IT'S STILL THE BLOOD THAT SAVES FROM SIN
A                          D        A
IT'S STILL THE BLOOD THAT CLEANSES WITHIN
D
FROM THE HIGHEST STAR IN HEAVEN
                     G
TO THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA
D
IT IS STILL THE BLOOD OF JESUS
A                      D
THAT BRINGS VICTORY TO ME


[Verse 2]
D
THERE ARE THOSE WHO RELY ON THINGS THAT THEY DO
A                          D               A
AND SOME MEN COUNT OF THE TIMES THEY PRAY THROUGH
D                                          G
BUT WHEN THE BATTLE'S OVER AND THE VICTORY WON
D                                      A            D
I'LL GO HOME THROUGH THE BLOOD OF THE FATHERS ONLY SON


[Chorus]
D
AND IT'S STILL THE BLOOD THAT SAVES FROM SIN
A                          D        A
IT'S STILL THE BLOOD THAT CLEANSES WITHIN
D
FROM THE HIGHEST STAR IN HEAVEN
                     G
TO THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA
D
IT IS STILL THE BLOOD OF JESUS
A                      D
THAT BRINGS VICTORY TO ME
