[Verse 1]
God looked high and low to find a man that He could choose
There was only one who stood among the rest that He could use
He said build a boat and tell the folks that the floods are about to rise
So Noah preached but no one believed when they heard the old man cry

[Chorus]
You better get on board while the door's still open, escape the rage on the rolling tide
Be sure that the rain is a coming and this old boat is about to ride
It won't be long 'till the wind starts blowing and the water's start to rise
This ship is about to set sail with the Lord
You Better get on board

[Verse 2]
God is looking far and wide to see who He can send
To go into the world and tell lost sinners to repent
It won't be long until the Father tells the Son that it's time to go
It's up to you and me to tell the world so they will know

[Chorus]
[Bridge]
The ground your standing on it may seem safe and dry right now
But if you don't heed the voice of God real soon you're gonna drown

[Chorus
