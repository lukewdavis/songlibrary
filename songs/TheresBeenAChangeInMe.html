			<pre>
[Verse 1]
Today I ran into the crowd that I used to hang around.
I told them that the world and I no longer could agree.
And when they asked my why this was my reply
There's been a change a change in me.

[Chorus]
There's been a change in me a change in me
Oh I am not the one that I used to be
Old things have passed away since Christ has set me free
There's been a change a change in me.

[Verse 2]
That old man you knew before he's gone forever more.
He's been covered by the blood shed on Calvary.
I am a brand new man I've been touched by God's own hand.
There's been a change a change in me.
