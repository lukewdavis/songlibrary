			<pre>
[Chorus]
God can fix it he's a fix it man
He fixes souls and bodies all over this land
He said he'd return to his home on high
Fix me a mansion up in the sky.
        
[Verse 1]
God created this world in six
Said it was in an awful fix
Without form or void darkness on the deep.
I'll fix a light so that you can see.
        
[Verse 2]
God said it wasn't good for man to be alone
From old Adam he took a bone
He made the woman, and he said from the start
This woman is yours till the day you part.
        
[Verse 3]
If every sinner in this fair land
Would take one trip to the fix it man
Go to him get it fixed for free
It would cure our sick society 

[Verse 4]
God started fixing me up inside
He said I'm looking for a place to abide
Give me your heart and live by the plan
You'll soon know I'm the fix it man.
        
[Verse 5]
Someday his son is coming back for his church
He said we'd be judged according to our works
So pour your heart and affections on me
And I'll fix your life for all eternity.
        
[Verse 6]
He fixes the black he fixes the white
Red, yellow, brown he fixes them right
Has no respect of person you see
For that same spirit he gave it to me.
