[Verse 1]
G       D#    D                  G
I don't worry, when skies are grey
        D#              D                     G
I don't bother with the darts Satan throws my way
        G                        F     G                        F
For the one who cares for sparrows and the lilies of the fields
       G                       
Is the one who calms the violent storms
        D             G
When he says peace be still

[Chorus]
G
He's good on the mountain
G
He's good in the valley low
     C
He's good in times of trouble
       D              G
That's why I love him so
G
He's good while I'm sleepin'
G
He's good when I'm on my knees
     C                 
He's good though I'm unworthy
D              G
He is good to me

[Verse 2]
G      D#      D           G
In the sunshine and in the rain
G     D#        D                   G
He is still the king of kings who remains the same
      G                       F
He is faithful to his children
        G                F
And his promises are true
      G           
If he says he'll always be there
       D 
That's exactly what he'll do
