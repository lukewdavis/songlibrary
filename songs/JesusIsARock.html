			<pre>
[Chorus]
My Lord is a rock in a weary land, weary land, weary land
My Lord is a rock in a weary land
A shelter in the the time of the storm

[Verse 1]
Stop and let me tell you about chapter one
When the lord Gods work had just begun
Stop and let me tell you about chapter two
When the lord God preached that Bible through
Stop and let me tell you about chapter three
When the lord God died up on Calvary

[Verse 2]
Now stop and let me tell you about chapter four
When the lord God visits among the poor
Stop and let me tell you about chapter five
When the lord God brought all the dead alive
Stop and let me tell you about chapter six
When he went to Jerusalem and healed the sick

[Verse 3]
Stop and let me tell you about chapter seven
When he died and he risen and he went to heaven
Stop and let me tell you about chapter eight
When the lord God was standin at the golden gate
Stop and let me tell you about chapter nine
When the lord God turned all the water to wine
