[Chorus]
I promised the Lord I'd make Him a soldier if He wrote my name
I promised the Lord I'd make Him a soldier if He wrote my name
I promised the Lord I'd make Him a soldier, I promised the Lord I'd make Him a soldier, 
I promised the Lord I'd make Him a soldier if He wrote my name.

[Verse 1]
He told me the world would hate me if he wrote my name
He told me the world would hate me if he wrote my name
He told me the world would hate me, He told me the world would hate me
He told me the world would hate me if he wrote my name

[Verse 2]
I said Lord that will be alright just write my name
I said Lord that will be alright just write my name
I said Lord that will be alright, write my name in the book of life
I said Lord that will be alright just write my name

[Verse 3]
I said I'd stay till the battle was over if he wrote my name
I said I'd stay till the battle was over if he wrote my name
I said I'd stay till the battle was over, I said I'd stay till the battle was over
I said I'd stay till the battle was over if he wrote my name
