			<pre>
[Chorus]
I'm going through, I'm going through
No matter what the devil throws at me I know what to do.
I'll call upon the name of the lord,
I'll pull out my shield and sword.
Satan you can't stop me, now I'm going through.

[Verse 1]
The preacher talked about the victory,
When god's children crossed the red sea.
How they walked across on dry land,
Phaorah's army drowned in the deep.
By the time he finished preaching,
It was plain to see, that god delivered,
Those before and he'll do it again for me.

[Verse 2]
If your going through a fiery trail,
And you don't know how to pray.
Just turn your eyes toward heaven,
And ask the lord today.
He'll fill you with power trust him and believe,
He'll put a song down in your heart.
Then you can sing with me.
