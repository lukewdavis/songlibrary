[Verse 1]
G                               G7
What happened to that Preacher, Who used to Preach so strong. 
Em7
What happened to that singer,Who used to sing our song. 
C                                  C7
The Preacher's out selling Amway, That singer's now singing country. 
D7
They sold out what is right for what is wrong. 
 

[Verse 2]
G                            G7
What happened to the church, That used to be on fire. 
Em7
What happened to the voices, That sang in the heavenly chior. 
C                                  C7
Oh, The Church has now grown dead and cold, 
 
The choir is silent, Cause nobody goes.
D
They sold out to the world and their own desires  
 

[Chorus]
C                       D    C        G        F          D
This heart belongs to Jesus, Cause he saved my soul from Hell. 
C                      D       C                     G    Em
This heart belongs to Jesus, This heart is not for sale.

Not for sale, Not for sale, No way no sir. 
 

[Verse 3]
G                           G7
Well a man from California, Called a few months ago. 
     Em7
He said boy with your talent , We can make alot of dough. 
C                                  C7

  D                                           G
But I belong to Jesus, And I'm just not for sale.

That old Devil's gonna try to get you some way. 
C                                  C7
He'll try you, And temp you, with his lies straight from hell. 
D                                                  G

I belong to the Lamb Of God, 
Em7

C                          D
I don't need popularity, I'd rather have what he gave to me. 
G               G7
I belong to the King of Kings,

Some sold conviction's for compromise, 
Em7
Some have sold the truth for a pack of lies.

Some have sold Testimonies for fortune and fame. 
D
I just want to Glorify and Magnify his name
