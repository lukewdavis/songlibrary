			<pre>
[Chorus]
When the Lord looks down from the Heavens to the ground,
I'm no bigger than a little grain of sand
Yet He knows me and He loves me and He holds me in His hand

[Verse 1]
God spoke to Abraham his servant
And told him of the blessings he would send
As the sand comes to sea without a number
I'm gonna bless your seed without an end

[Verse 2]
I often think about the Great Creation
How God made the mountains and the sea
He made us all and everyone is special
There's not another person just like me

[Verse 3]
So when it seems I'm caught up in the middle
of this troubled world and people all around
It's good to know I'm one of His creations
He sees me and He knows just where I am
