[Chorus]
G                  C         G
I'm going through, I'm going through
G                                     D
No matter what the devil throws at me I know what to do.
     G
I'll call upon the name of the lord,
C
I'll pull out my shield and sword.
G                            D          G
Satan you can't stop me, now I'm going through.

[Verse 1]
G
The preacher talked about the victory,
           C                        G
When god's children crossed the red sea.
G
How they walked across on dry land,
          D
Phaorah's army drowned in the deep.
       G
By the time he finished preaching,
       C        G
It was plain to see, that god delivered,
                       D               G
Those before and he'll do it again for me.

[Verse 2]
        G           
If your going through a fiery trail,
        C                 G
And you don't know how to pray.
G
Just turn your eyes toward heaven,
    D     
And ask the lord today.
      G                            C             G
He'll fill you with His power just trust him and believe,
G
He'll put a song down in your heart.
     D                 G
Then you can sing with me.
