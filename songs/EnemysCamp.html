[Verse]
Well I went to the enemy's camp and I
Took back what he stole from me
Took back what he stole from me
Took back what he stole from me
Well I went to the enemy's camp and I
Took back what he stole from me
He's under my feet
He's under my feet
He's under my feet
He's under my feet
He's under my feet
He's under my feet
Satan is under my feet.

[Verse]
Look what the Lord has done
Look what the Lord has done
He healed my body
He touched my mind
He saved me just in time

Oh I'm gonna praise His Name
Each day is just the same
Come on and praise Him
Look what the Lord has done.
