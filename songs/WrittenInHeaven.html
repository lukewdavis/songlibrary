[Verse 1]

I may never see my name up in lights
Or carved on some monument wall
It may never be listed alongside the heroes
As history's great deeds are recalled
And if I search through the credits
That roll 'cross the screen
My name might never be found
But there is one place, there is one page
Where it has been written down

[Chorus]
My name is written in Heaven
Oh, hallelujah
It's writtеn in Heaven for etеrnity
What on earth can compare
It's written in Heaven
And that's all that matters to me
Oh, that's all that matters to me

[Verse 2]
How can I describe this joy that I feel
This peace that I have in my soul
Just to know that my name is recorded among
The redeemed on that Heavenly roll
Oh, what fame or fortune could mean much to me
Compared to the gift of God's grace
Written by Christ in His book of life
And it will not be erased

[Turnaroud]
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is called up yonder
    </pre>
