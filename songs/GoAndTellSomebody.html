[Chorus]
Go and tell somebody what He's done for you.
Go and tell somebody what the Lord can do.
How He gave you vict'ry, how He's brought you through.
Go and tell somebody what He's done for you.

[Verse 1]
There once was a blind man, the Lord gave him sight.
He had to tell somebody, he couldn't keep it quite.
For once He's touched you, you're never the same,
You gotta tell somebody, you gotta praise His name.

[Verse 2]
Now there was a cripple sitting by the road,
But when he met Jesus he was then made whole.
I can see him walking, then he starts to run,
He had to tell somebody what the Lord had done.
