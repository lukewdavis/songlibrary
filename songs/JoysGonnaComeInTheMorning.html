[Verse 1]
  E                                                   B
I struggled with old satan's myth my life would never change.
       B                                                  E 
With a broken heart as things grew dark I called on Jesus name.
  E                                                      A
I must confess my soul is at rest satan better heed this warning.
                                  E       B                       E
God said it's done the victory is won and joy's gonna come in the morning.

[Chorus]
     E                                                          B
Hallelujah I hear the voice of the Lord joy's gonna come in the morning.
    B                                                              E
The sun's gonna shine it's just about time joy's gonna come in the morning.
                        E                              A
The devil has lost this battle, he can't hold back the dawning.
              E                      B                       E
Weeping may endure for the night but joy's gonna come in the morning.

[Verse 2]
       E                                                          B
You've fought the fight to stand the night the darkness seemed so long.
    B                                                E
You held onto the power you knew and it has made you strong.
   E                                                 A
No stopping now by faith somehow you see the light a dawning.
                 E           B                       E
That eastern sky bye and bye joy's gonna come in the morning.
