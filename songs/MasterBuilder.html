[Verse 1]
  G
Jesus was a carpenter a long time ago
                                  G7
Joseph taught Him all the things He needed to know
     C                                                      G     F F#
He grew up straight and strong, working on the shores of Galilee
      G
He learned to use a hammer, and He learned to drive a nail
                                    G7
And when He finished building, it served Him mighty well
            C                                                      G         G7
Cause He started on a building that stretched from sky to sky and sea to sea
 

[Chorus]
                       C
Jesus is the Master Builder
                             G
He built His church upon a rock
                            D       D7
He built it upon a firm foundation
                          G   G7
And the work will never stop
                       C
Jesus is the Master Builder
                               G
He takes the old and makes it new
                       D             D7             C     C7
He can take a life of sin, make it clean and pure within
N.C                        G   F# G Ab
And He can make a brand new you
 

[Verse 2]
 G
Now He's back in Heaven and He's building once again
                                  G7
He's working on a city called the New Jerusalem
    C                                                G          F F#
It sits on firm foundations according to the Master Builder's plan
      G
The streets are lined with mansions for the saints to move right in
                                        G7
And when He's finished building, He'll come back again
     C                                                     G  G7
To take us to that city fashioned by the Master Builder's hand
