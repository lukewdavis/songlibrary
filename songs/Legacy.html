[Verse 1]
I come from a long line of those who trusted Jesus
Those who planted seeds of faith so many years ago
Though I don't know all their names, still their heritage remains
I know I'm saved today because of seeds they sowed

[Chorus 1]
They left a legacy of faith
Pointing the way to Jesus Christ
They left a history of hope
By the way they lived their lives
Though many are gone, their words live on
And we who follow clearly see that they loved Jesus
For they left a legacy

[Verse 2]
Today I live today so that those who come tomorrow
Will see my love for Christ in each memory of me
And I pray that they will find the path I've left behind
And that following my steps will lead them to believe

[Chorus 2]
I wanna leave a legacy of faith
Pointing the way to Jesus Christ
I wanna leave a history of hope
By the way I live my life
I pray when I'm gone, my words live on
And those who follow clearly see that I loved Jesus
For I left a legacy

[Bridge]
This life is but a vapor
So soon my days will pass
What I do for Jesus is the only thing that will last
