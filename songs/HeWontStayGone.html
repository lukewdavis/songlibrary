[Verse 1]
Jesus told the chosen, his body would be broken
But He would surely rise from the dead
He did it like He said it, and then when He ascended
He promised He's be coming back again

[Chorus]
He didn't stay dead and He won't stay gone
He'll roll back the clouds like He rolled back the stone
If you trust His word, rest assured, you can't go wrong
Cause He didn't stay dead and He won't stay gone

[Verse 2]
Scorners mock it, but nothing will stop it
And one day they will know that it's true
I'm trusting and awaiting
Watching and praying
Cause I believe it's gonna be soon

[Bridge]
I'm just gonna keep my eyes on the eastern sky
For I know that I know my redemption's drawing nigh
